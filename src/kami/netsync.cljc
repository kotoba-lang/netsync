  "hiccup for replication — what crosses the wire, described as EDN. A schema names the
   synced components, their fields, authority, and interpolation. The wire payload is
   derived from the schema, not hand-coded; store the schema as datoms, fork it, retune
   bandwidth without touching transport code.

   Pure + cross-platform (.cljc): `snapshot` extracts the wire payload; `apply-snapshot`
   merges a received one; `interp` blends toward a target per each component's :interp.
   The same EDN drives any transport (WebRTC/WebSocket here-or-later).")
