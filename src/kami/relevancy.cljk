(ns kami.relevancy
  "Who receives which entity — area-of-interest filtering, as EDN.

   `kami.netsync` answers *what crosses the wire* for an entity (which fields,
   which authority, how to interpolate). It does not answer *whether that entity
   crosses the wire to you at all*, and without that answer every observer
   receives every entity: bandwidth grows as observers x entities, so doubling
   the players quadruples the traffic. That is the ceiling this namespace exists
   to remove.

   ## Three things, not one

   1. **A relevant set.** Which entity ids an observer should be receiving now.
   2. **Hysteresis.** An entity hovering on the boundary must not enter and leave
      every tick. Flicker is worse than either state: each crossing costs a spawn
      and a despawn, so a single jittering entity can cost more bandwidth than
      simply always sending it. Enter and exit use different radii.
   3. **A delta.** The wire wants `:entered` / `:left`, not the whole set — the
      set is what you keep, the delta is what you send.

   ## Why a grid

   The obvious implementation compares every observer against every entity. It is
   also the thing being replaced, so it stays here as [[brute-force-relevant]]
   and the tests assert the grid agrees with it exactly. Bucketing entities into
   cells of the interest radius means an observer examines a fixed neighbourhood
   (at most 3x3x3 cells in 3D) instead of the whole world, which is what turns
   observers x entities into observers x local-density.

   The cell size is the *exit* radius, never smaller: a cell smaller than the
   query radius would need a wider neighbourhood sweep, and the 3x3x3 bound
   silently stops being a bound.

   Pure and cross-platform. No transport, no clock, no mutation: an observer's
   previous set is passed in and the next one is returned, so a caller can keep
   it wherever it keeps state."

   Hysteresis lives entirely in the second pass. An earlier version also chose
   the radius per entity *inside* the sweep, which produced the same answers —
   a mutation test showed that inline condition could be deleted without any gate
   noticing, because retention re-admitted everything it had excluded. Two
   mechanisms for one rule, and only one of them load-bearing.

   Retention also has to exist for a reason the sweep cannot cover: it is what
   *drops* an entity. The sweep can only add, so an entity that moved far away
   would stay relevant forever if retention did not re-measure it."
